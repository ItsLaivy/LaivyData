/**
 * This package contains the native SQLite support for LaivyData.
 * <p>
 *     The native SQLite support of LaivyData is a bit buggy, still doing some changes, here is some limitations that you need to know:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Default values doesn't works here;</li>
 *         <li>LaivyData temporary dropped support.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     In the future, we pretend to do a better native SQLite support, but not for now.
 * </p>
